Description | This query sums the total cost and conversions by month and year from the `adgroup_performance_report`.
Usage | This query can be used to create a line or bar chart of cost and conversions over time.
Modifications | The table in the `FROM` might need to be changed based on Schema and Destination settings in the data source. The columns `ad group` or `campaign` can be added to the `WHERE` as filters or to the `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` for an additional level of aggregation granularity.

  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "day") "year",
